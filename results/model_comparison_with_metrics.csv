 ""1 Introduction Rapid development of deep learning has brought significant improvement to semantic segmentation. The iconic frameworks [60], [3] have profited a wide range of applications of automatic driving, robot vision, medical image, etc. The performance of these frameworks, however, worsens quickly without sufficient fully labeled data or when working on unseen classes. Even if additional data is provided, fine tuning is still time and resource consuming. To address this issue, few shot segmentation was proposed [33] where data is divided into a support set and a query set. As shown in Figure 1, images from both support and query sets are first sent to the backbone network to extract features. Feature processing can be accomplished by generating weights for the classifier [33], [41], cosine similarity calculation [5], [45], [23], or convolutions [15], [54],[49], [9], [1] to generate the final prediction. The support set provides information about the target class that helps the model to make accurate segmentation prediction on the query images. This process mimics the scenario where a model makes the prediction of unseen classes on testing images( query) with few labeled data( support ). Therefore, a few shot model needs to quickly adapt to the new classes. However, the common problems of existing few shot segmentation methods include generalization loss due to misuse of high level features and spatial inconsistency between the query and support samples. In this paper, we mainly tackle these two difficulties. Generalization Reduction& High level Features Com \u000fZ. Tia n (ti an zhuo tao@ link .cuhk.edu.hk), H. Zhao and J.

Summary of recent few shot segmentation frameworks. The backbone method used to extract support and query features can be either a single shared network or two Siamese networks. mon semantic segmentation models rely heavily on high level features with semantic information. Experiments of Cane t [54] show that simply adding high level features during feature processing in a few shot model causes performance drop. Thus the way to utilize semantic information in the few shot setting is not straightforward. Unlike previous methods, we use Image Net [32] pret rained high level features of the query and support images to produce ‘ priors ’ for the model. These priors help the model to better identify targets in query images. Since the prior generation process is training free, the resulting model does not lose the generalization ability to unseen classes, despite the frequent use of high level information of seen classes during training. Spatial Inconsistency Besides, due to the limited samples, scale and pose of each support object may vary greatly from its query target, which we call spatial inconsistency. To ar Xiv :2008.01449v1  [cs.CV]  4 Aug 20202 tackle this problem, we propose a new module named Feature Enrichment Module( Fem) to adaptively enrich query features with the support features. Ablation study in Section 4.3 shows that merely incorporating the multi scale scheme to tackle the spatial inconsistency is suboptimal by showing that Fem provides conditioned feature selection that helps retain essential information passed across different scales. Fem achieves superior performance than other multi scale structures, such a shr Net [44], Ppm [60], Asp P [4] and GAU [53]. Finally, based on the proposed prior generation method and Feature Enrichment Module( Fem ), we build a new network – Prior Guided Feature Enrichment Network (PFE Net ). The Res Net 50 based PFE Net only contains 10.8M learn able parameters, and yet achieves new state of the art results on both Pascal 5i[33] and Coco [21] benchmark with 15.9 and 5.1 Fps with 1 shot and 5 shot settings respectively. Moreover, we manifest the effectiveness by applying our model to the zero shot scenario where no labeled data is available. The result is surprising – PFE Net sill achieves decent performance without major structural modification.

The Fully Convolution al Network (FCN) [34] is developed for semantic segmentation by replacing the fully connected layer in a classification framework with convolution al layers. Following approaches, such as Deep Lab [3], DPN [24] and CRFRNN [62], utilize CRF/MRF to help refine coarse prediction. The receptive field is important for semantic segmentation; thus Deep Lab [3] and Dilation [50] introduce the dilated convolution to enlarge the receptive field. Encoder decoder structures [31], [10], [20] are adopted to help reconstruct and refine segmentation in steps. Contextual information is vital for complex scene understanding. Parse Net [22] applies global pooling for semantic segmentation. PSP Net [60] utilizes a Pyramid Pooling Module (PPM) for context information aggregation over different regions, which is very effective. Deep Lab [3] develops at ro us spatial pyramid pooling( Asp P) with filters in different dilation rates. Attention models are also introduced .PSA Net [61] develops point wise spatial attention with a bidirectional information propagation paradigm. Channel wise attention [55] and non local style attention [56], [8],[51], [16] are also effective for segmentation. These methods work well on large sample classes. They are not designed to deal with rare and unseen classes. They also can not be easily adapted without fine tuning .2.2 Few shot Learning Few shot learning aims at image classification when only a few training examples are available. There are meta learning based methods [2], [11], [7] and metric learning ones [43],[40], [37], [52]. Data is essential to deep models; therefore, several methods improve performance by synthesizing more training samples [57], [13], [47]. Different from few shot learning where prediction is at the image level, few shot segmentation makes pixel level predictions, which is much more challenging. Our work closely relates to metric learning based few shot learning methods. Prototypical network [37] is trained to map input data to a metric space where classes are represented as prototypes. During inference, classification is achieved by finding the closest prototype for each input image, because data belonging to the same class should be close to the prototype. Another representative metric based work is the relation network [40] that projects query and support images to 1 \u00021 vectors and then performs classification based on the cosine similarity between them .2.3 Few shot Segmentation Few shot segmentation places the general semantic segmentation in a few shot scenario, where models perform dense pixel la be ling on new classes with only a few support samples. OSLSM [33] first tackles few shot segmentation by learning to generate weights of the classifier for each class. PL [5] applies prototyping [37] to the segmentation task.

 Now the material ends. What improvements could be made to further enhance the ability of this automatic optimisation model generator?","
Possible improvements could include:

1. Using larger and more advanced language models. The paper used GPT-3.5 models, but newer GPT models with more parameters and training data exist that could produce better optimisation models.

2. Combining the language model generation with techniques like evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning to iteratively improve the generated models. This could correct errors and optimize for objectives like model complexity.

3. Gathering more training data of high-quality, human-written optimisation models to expose the language models to. This could improve their effectiveness in reproducing valid and correct optimisation models.

4. Providing more explicit and targeted error messages when optimisation models contain errors. The current approach of using the error message to provide feedback may be too generic. More targeted feedback could help the language model fix specific issues.

5. Extending the approach to other optimisation modelling languages beyond just MiniZinc. This could demonstrate the general effectiveness and broad applicability of the method.

In summary, there are many potential avenues to improve this initial prototype automatic optimisation model generator through techniques like using more advanced language models, combining ML with optimization algorithms, gathering more training data, providing better error messages, and exploring other optimization languages. The paper provides a good starting point, but leaves ample room for future improvement.","Potential areas for improvement include:

3. Gathering more detailed feedback from the user after initial model generation. The paper uses a simple error message to provide feedback, but more nuanced feedback could guide the model towards further improvements.

4. Utilizing techniques for generating complex constraints and relations between variables. The paper focused on basic variables and constraints, but real-world optimisation models require handling of more complex relations.

 ""1 Introduction Abs tractive summarization is a natural language processing technique that involves generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer piece of text while preserving its most important information (Yao eta l., 2017). Query focused abs tractive summarization is a specific type of abs tractive summarization that generates a summary of the given text that is tailored to a specific query or topic of interest( Baum e let al ., 2018; Goodwin eta l., 2020; Suet al ., 2020; Xu and Lap at a, 2021; La ska ret al .,2020a,b, 2022d). In other words, the summary is focused on answering a specific question or addressing a particular topic, rather than providing \u0003 Contact Author .y All work being done at York University. a general overview of the text. One widely used data set for this task is the Debate ped ia1 data set that consists of arguments and counterarguments on conversational topics (Nem aet al ., 2017). The query focused summarization of argumentative text is a challenging task that has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various domains, such as policymaking, journalism, and legal reasoning (Nem aet al ., 2017; La ska ret al ., 2020a). However, it has been recently found that the quality of the Debate ped i a data set that is widely used for the query focused abs tractive summarization task is limited by noise, with many of the queries in this data set does not have any relevance with the source document (L ask a ret al ., 2022d). Since Debate ped i a is a rich source of argumentative text on controversial topics that can serve as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating summarization models, in this paper, we present a novel methodology to annotate the Debate ped i a data set to make it a useful resource for query focused abs tractive summarization. Our data annotation approach leverages the language mode ling( Rad ford eta l., 2019) capabilities of Chat GPT2, a large pret rained language model (Devl in eta l., 2018; Brown eta l., 2020;Ou yang eta l., 2022) that has shown an impressive capability of generating fluent and coherent text (Q in eta l., 2023; Bang eta l., 2023; Yang eta l.,2023; Kuz manet al ., 2023; Gao eta l., 2023; Wan get al ., 2023; Zhou eta l., 2023; Ko co  ́ net al ., 2023;Kocmi and Fed erma nn, 2023).

As a result, the summarization models have unexpected access to the keywords in the gold reference summaries. Among the data sets mentioned above, DUC and Aqua Muse require generating summaries from multiple documents, usually from the news domain. The QM Sum data set is proposed for query based meeting summarization, while Wiki How QA is constructed from the Wiki How knowledge base and used for answer summary generation for questions that start with “ How to ”. Meanwhile, Pub Med QA and Med iQA data sets are constructed from the biomedical domain. One notable exception among these data sets is the Debate ped i a data set since it requires generating abs tractive summaries from a short document containing argumentative text. None of the other data sets mentioned above addressed the issue of generating query based summaries from documents containing arguments and counterarguments. This makes Debate ped i a a great resource for researchers to develop methods to summarize a short document containing argumentative text for the given query. However, it has been found recently that many samples in the Debate ped i a data set are not actually query oriented (L ask a ret al ., 2022d). Moreover, it was also observed that fine tuning pret rained neural models in this data set without considering the query incorporation could achieve almost similar performance as the query focused summarization models (L ask a ret al ., 2022d).

For that purpose, we propose a novel methodology that leverages the text generation capability of prompt based language models (Liu eta l., 2023; Ou yang eta l., 2022; Brown eta l., 2020).

 Now the material ends. What are some potential limitations of using Chat GPT to annotate the Debatepedia dataset as described in this paper?","
Potential answers:

1. Chat GPT is prone to generating factually incorrect or unrepresentative text. Since it is a language model trained on public web data, it does not necessarily generate factually accurate information. When generating new query formulations, Chat GPT may produce queries that do not accurately represent the original document or the ideal summary.

2. Chat GPT has its own biases that may perpetuate in the annotated data. Since the model was trained on data from the internet which contains societal biases, Chat GPT itself exhibits biases that can propagate into the annotations it generates. This could disadvantage certain groups in the annotated Debatepedia dataset.  

3. Chat GPT is not tailored specifically for the task of query formulation. Since it is a general-purpose Language model, it was not explicitly trained for the task of generating queries that accurately represent argumentative texts. Therefore, it may struggle to produce high-quality, relevant queries that correspond well to the Debatepedia documents.

4. The outputs from Chat GPT may lack diversity. Since Chat GPT generates outputs based on its statistical language model, there is a risk of it producing similar or repetitive queries that lack the diversity needed for a comprehensive dataset. This could limit the ability of models trained on the annotated data to generalize.

","Potential answers could include:

• Chat GPT is prone to generating factually incorrect or unrepresentative text, since it is a language model trained on public web data that may contain errors. This could potentially contaminate the cleaned Debatepedia dataset.

• Chat GPT is not tailored specifically for query formulation or abstractive summarization, so its ability to generate relevant and high-quality queries may be limited. It was used more as a convenience tool in this paper. 

• Chat GPT may struggle to generate concise and coherent summaries that are focused on answering specific questions, since it was primarily developed for general text generation. This could result in long or rambling summaries.

• Since Chat GPT is a black-box model, it is difficult to determine how it arrived at its annotations and whether they are of high quality. There are no built-in mechanisms to evaluate or validate the annotations it generates.

• Annotating a dataset as large as Debatepedia using Chat GPT would require a significant amount of computational resources, since GPT models require many parameters and computations to generate text. This could limit its practical application for larger datasets.",0.3133327810420912,0.32000000000000006,0.3467279305276935

"Below is a paper. Memorize the material and answer my question after the paper.
 ""I. Introduction Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without requiring data owners to share their private data. The privacy protection advantages of FL have gained significant attention from both academic and industrial fields. However, to obtain high quality models in FL, more clients are needed for local training, which inevitably consumes resources such as computation and communication costs. Additionally, recent advanced attack approaches have increased the risk of privacy leakage for clients in FL. As a result, no client is willing to participate in FL without reasonable compensation. Therefore, designing an incentive mechanism for FL is crucial in light of these considerations. In previous studies, researchers have explored designing incentive mechanisms to induce clients ’ participation based on simply assumptions on clients ’ capacities. For example, Zh an get al. [1] leverage historical clients ’ performance to estimate Correspondence to: LiChu ants a i <1201500112@jxufe.edu.cn> their current capacities and reputation, and design a reverse auction based incentive mechanism. A reputation based clients selection scheme is also combined with contract theory for FL incentive mechanism design [2]. Other studies consider the relationship between clients ’ hardware and their computation capacity or assume a deterministic capacity in problem settings [3]-[6]. However, none of these studies fully address the challenge of accurately estimating clients ’ capacities, such as their communication and computation abilities, in each round. One major challenge in estimating clients ’ capacities is that in cross device FL, clients are often Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited computation and communication abilities. The situation of these IoTs can be highly dependent on factors such as battery level and communication channels, which can introduce uncertainty and instability over time. Another challenge in accurately estimating clients ’ capacities is that clients ’ situations may be correlated. This is because different clients may share similar constraints, which may come from their participating activities, exposed environments, and their self physical constraint. As a result, estimating clients ’ capacities is often biased, which can lead to suboptimal choices when using existing incentive mechanisms in FL. Resolving these challenges is the core motivation of our work. In this paper, we consider a universal cross device FL, which contains wireless communication infrastructures and numerous IoTs. Then we propose a multilevel cross device FL architecture with the following contributions. To reward allocation under the limited budget and total utility optimization, we take the stochastic situations of clients into consideration. By anal y zing clients ’ historical performance and their correlation property in our FL architecture, portfolio theory is firstly leveraged to address this issue. The main contributions of our work can be summarized in the following points :\u000 four proposed multilevel cross device FL architecture is tailored to the demands of a universal cross device FL system featuring wireless communication infrastructures and a multitude of IoTs. The architecture is crafted to be highly adaptable and practical for real world implementation .\u000f Through our analysis of the uncertainty and correlation properties of clients in cross device FL, we investigate the ar Xiv :2305.04081v1  [cs.GT]  6 May 2023 challenges related to accurately estimating their capacities in light of these factors. As pioneers in this domain, we firstly propose the application of portfolio theory to tackle the capacity estimation challenges in cross device FL and design an effective incentive mechanism for it .\u000f To better capture the practical FL scenarios, we propose the Federated Learning Agent based Model (F Lab M) to simulate autonomous clients of FL. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach is significantly more effective and outperforms the benchmark methods. Ii. Related Work A key prerequisite for effective incentive mechanism design in FL is providing sufficient rewards to induce clients to participate in collaborative training. Previous studies in this field focus on addressing two subproblem s: fairness and optimization. While contribution measurement approaches such ass hap ley value and its variations have been widely used to address fairness problems in previous work [12], [13], they are less relevant for the optimizations, and particularly not related to biased sub optimality issues mentioned in this paper. To address the optimization problem, pioneers apply game theory based methods such as auction theory, Stack el berg game, and contract theory for incentive mechanism design. Deep reinforcement learning, a common means to solve dynamic problems in game theory, is also leveraged to compute Nash equilibrium and social welfare maximum [6], [7], [9], [14]. Zen get al. propose F More, in which the clients submit their bids with promised capacities to the aggregation server [8]. In their paper [9], Jiao eta l. do not take into account the stochastic property of clients ’ capacities, and propose an incentive mechanism for maximizing social welfare using deep reinforcement learning. In [6], clients deterministically decide their participation level based on per unit costs of communication and computation under given the total reward. The studies by Kan get al. [2] and Z hang eta l. [1] both employ a reputation mechanism for estimating clients ’ capacities and selecting nodes, by exploiting their historical performance .Zha net al. [7] propose an incentive mechanism, in which the clients automatically learn the best strategy based on deep reinforcement learning. In other settings, clients are able to determine their computation capacity to optimize their utility function [3]-[5]. However, all these works do not consider the uncertainty of clients ’ capacities over time, which can be obviously observed in Table I. Iii. Multi Level Federated Learning Architecture In vanilla FL model training process, the aggregation server coordinates with different clients to optimize the objectives .........WtWtWtWt Fig. 1. Overview of Multilevel Federated Learning Architecture. The three layers from top to bottom consist of aggregation servers (MBSs), edge computing devices (EBSs), and clients (IoTs). collaboratively. Here, the objective function of the optimization is formulated as: min w2RdF(w) :=1NNXn=1fn(w); (1)fn( w),E(x;y)\u0018X[fn(w;x;y)]; (2) where wis the parameters of the global model and fn(w) is the local loss function. Based on the number of clients N,FL can be broadly divided into two categories: cross device FL and cross silo FL. The fundamental disparity between cross silo settings and cross device FL is that the former involves learning across a limited number of organizations that possess ample data, while the latter involves Internet of Things (IoT) clients, which can number in the millions. Consequently, the clients in cross device Flare much more unstable due to varying factors ’ status such as battery level, communication channel, and other limited resources. This results in unpredictable fluctuations in the number of time steps taken by IoTs. This paper focuses on cross device FL and proposes a multilevel federated learning architecture comprising IoTs, Edge Base Stations (EBSs), and Macro Base Stations (MBSs), as depicted in Fig. 1. The FL aggregation servers in this architecture can be high performance MBSs with abundant communication and computation resources, while the clients can be mobile devices with limited communication and computation resources. Notably, most of these mobile devices ’ conditions are unstable in real time due to the aforementioned reasons. As for EBSs, their computation and communication capabilities are intermediate between those of MBSs and IoTs. During the training process, MBSs function as aggregation servers and initialize the global model, which they then send model parameters to EBSs. Subsequently, EBSs regulate a group of IoTs and transfer these parameters to them. Like in conventional FL, these IoTs use their own data and local resources to update parameters and send them back to the transfer station, EBSs. Finally, MBSs are employed to perform 
 Now the material ends. Question: How does the proposed multilevel FL architecture address the challenges of accurately estimating clients' capacities?","
Answer: The paper proposes applying portfolio theory to tackle the challenges of accurately estimating clients' capacities in multilevel FL. By analyzing clients' historical performance and their correlation properties in the architecture, portfolio theory is leveraged to address the following issues:

1) The uncertainty and instability of IoT clients' capacities over time due to factors like battery level and communication channels.  

2) The correlation between different clients' capacities, which come from their similar constraints, participating activities, environments, and physical constraints.  

By taking these stochastic situations of clients into consideration, portfolio theory helps determine how to allocate rewards under a limited budget and optimize the total utility, thereby providing a more effective way to estimate clients' capacities and design incentive mechanisms for FL. This is the first work that proposes applying portfolio theory to solve the capacity estimation challenges in cross-device FL.","Answer: The paper proposes applying portfolio theory to tackle the challenges of accurately estimating clients' capacities in multilevel FL.

This is the first work that proposes applying portfolio theory to solve the capacity estimation challenges in cross-device FL.",0.8963445527337642,0.9463087248322147,0.987305550497557

 ""I. Introduction Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without requiring data owners to share their private data. The privacy protection advantages of FL have gained significant attention from both academic and industrial fields. However, to obtain high quality models in FL, more clients are needed for local training, which inevitably consumes resources such as computation and communication costs. Additionally, recent advanced attack approaches have increased the risk of privacy leakage for clients in FL. As a result, no client is willing to participate in FL without reasonable compensation. Therefore, designing an incentive mechanism for FL is crucial in light of these considerations. In previous studies, researchers have explored designing incentive mechanisms to induce clients ’ participation based on simply assumptions on clients ’ capacities. For example, Zh an get al. [1] leverage historical clients ’ performance to estimate Correspondence to: LiChu ants a i <1201500112@jxufe.edu.cn> their current capacities and reputation, and design a reverse auction based incentive mechanism. A reputation based clients selection scheme is also combined with contract theory for FL incentive mechanism design [2]. Other studies consider the relationship between clients ’ hardware and their computation capacity or assume a deterministic capacity in problem settings [3]-[6]. However, none of these studies fully address the challenge of accurately estimating clients ’ capacities, such as their communication and computation abilities, in each round. One major challenge in estimating clients ’ capacities is that in cross device FL, clients are often Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited computation and communication abilities. The situation of these IoTs can be highly dependent on factors such as battery level and communication channels, which can introduce uncertainty and instability over time. Another challenge in accurately estimating clients ’ capacities is that clients ’ situations may be correlated. This is because different clients may share similar constraints, which may come from their participating activities, exposed environments, and their self physical constraint. As a result, estimating clients ’ capacities is often biased, which can lead to suboptimal choices when using existing incentive mechanisms in FL. Resolving these challenges is the core motivation of our work. In this paper, we consider a universal cross device FL, which contains wireless communication infrastructures and numerous IoTs. Then we propose a multilevel cross device FL architecture with the following contributions. To reward allocation under the limited budget and total utility optimization, we take the stochastic situations of clients into consideration. By anal y zing clients ’ historical performance and their correlation property in our FL architecture, portfolio theory is firstly leveraged to address this issue. The main contributions of our work can be summarized in the following points :\u000 four proposed multilevel cross device FL architecture is tailored to the demands of a universal cross device FL system featuring wireless communication infrastructures and a multitude of IoTs.

As pioneers in this domain, we firstly propose the application of portfolio theory to tackle the capacity estimation challenges in cross device FL and design an effective incentive mechanism for it .\u000f To better capture the practical FL scenarios, we propose the Federated Learning Agent based Model (F Lab M) to simulate autonomous clients of FL. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach is significantly more effective and outperforms the benchmark methods. Ii. Related Work A key prerequisite for effective incentive mechanism design in FL is providing sufficient rewards to induce clients to participate in collaborative training. Previous studies in this field focus on addressing two subproblem s: fairness and optimization. While contribution measurement approaches such ass hap ley value and its variations have been widely used to address fairness problems in previous work [12], [13], they are less relevant for the optimizations, and particularly not related to biased sub optimality issues mentioned in this paper. To address the optimization problem, pioneers apply game theory based methods such as auction theory, Stack el berg game, and contract theory for incentive mechanism design. Deep reinforcement learning, a common means to solve dynamic problems in game theory, is also leveraged to compute Nash equilibrium and social welfare maximum [6], [7], [9], [14]. Zen get al. propose F More, in which the clients submit their bids with promised capacities to the aggregation server [8]. In their paper [9], Jiao eta l. do not take into account the stochastic property of clients ’ capacities, and propose an incentive mechanism for maximizing social welfare using deep reinforcement learning. In [6], clients deterministically decide their participation level based on per unit costs of communication and computation under given the total reward. The studies by Kan get al. [2] and Z hang eta l. [1] both employ a reputation mechanism for estimating clients ’ capacities and selecting nodes, by exploiting their historical performance .Zha net al. [7] propose an incentive mechanism, in which the clients automatically learn the best strategy based on deep reinforcement learning. In other settings, clients are able to determine their computation capacity to optimize their utility function [3]-[5]. However, all these works do not consider the uncertainty of clients ’ capacities over time, which can be obviously observed in Table I. Iii. Multi Level Federated Learning Architecture In vanilla FL model training process, the aggregation server coordinates with different clients to optimize the objectives .........WtWtWtWt Fig. 1. Overview of Multilevel Federated Learning Architecture. The three layers from top to bottom consist of aggregation servers (MBSs), edge computing devices (EBSs), and clients (IoTs). collaboratively. Here, the objective function of the optimization is formulated as: min w2RdF(w) :=1NNXn=1fn(w); (1)fn( w),E(x;y)\u0018X[fn(w;x;y)]; (2) where wis the parameters of the global model and fn(w) is the local loss function. Based on the number of clients N,FL can be broadly divided into two categories: cross device FL and cross silo FL. The fundamental disparity between cross silo settings and cross device FL is that the former involves learning across a limited number of organizations that possess ample data, while the latter involves Internet of Things (IoT) clients, which can number in the millions. Consequently, the clients in cross device Flare much more unstable due to varying factors ’ status such as battery level, communication channel, and other limited resources. This results in unpredictable fluctuations in the number of time steps taken by IoTs. This paper focuses on cross device FL and proposes a multilevel federated learning architecture comprising IoTs, Edge Base Stations (EBSs), and Macro Base Stations (MBSs), as depicted in Fig. 1. The FL aggregation servers in this architecture can be high performance MBSs with abundant communication and computation resources, while the clients can be mobile devices with limited communication and computation resources. Notably, most of these mobile devices ’ conditions are unstable in real time due to the aforementioned reasons. As for EBSs, their computation and communication capabilities are intermediate between those of MBSs and IoTs. During the training process, MBSs function as aggregation servers and initialize the global model, which they then send model parameters to EBSs. Subsequently, EBSs regulate a group of IoTs and transfer these parameters to them. Like in conventional FL, these IoTs use their own data and local resources to update parameters and send them back to the transfer station, EBSs. Finally, MBSs are employed to perform

 ""I. Introduction  In general, pitch estimation follows the process of short time analysis or note duration for input audio as follows. 1) Get the note duration from onset detection. 2) Compute the pitch of each frame by applying different methods. 3) Get several high peaks that contain fundamental frequency( f0) and its harmonics and a small peak before f0 which is subharmonic s. The harmonics and sub harmonics are represented as                                       n ൈ  f  and ଵ௡௧௛ൈ f              (1)      where f is f଴ and n is an integer. Under clean signal scenarios, most time domain methods like the autocorrelation function (ACF) and normalized dynamic spectral features (NDSFs) [1], and frequency domain methods like the cep strum [6] and the harmonic product spectrum (HPS) [2] work well.  The main concept of the NSDF and the ACF [1] is the inner product of the overlap part between the original frame xሺtሻ,t ൌ0, ... n െ 1  and the shift of frame xሺtሻ with τ delayed in terms of xሺtെτ ሻ. τ is the time lag of the original signal.  The HPS [2] is to compute the product of the spectrum of audio and its compressed spectrum of audio. The property of HPS is that each compressed spectrum has a peak around its f଴, then the product of all spectrum makes the f଴ even higher value. The short time Fourier transform (STFT) [3] is common in the audio and image processing realm because St FT outputs a spectrogram as in Fig. 1. If we sum up the energy along the frequency axis from the transposed spectrogram, we can obtain the energy distribution of a single note in frequency. The max likelihood (ML) method is to use an impulse function with f଴ and its 4 octaves. Then convolve the impulse function with the spectrum of a note and sum over the value to get the pitch f଴ of a note.  Fig. 1.  Spectrogram for pitch estimation and onset detection  Table I.

In speech analysis, speech can be de convolved into excitation signal and formant structure. It uses linear prediction analysis to estimate excitation. The deep learning (DL) method Crepe method [5] is data driven and the training is computation cost, we only use the pret rained model to improve the pitch analysis. The overview of pitch method research is in Table I.  Ii. Proposed Pitch Estimation  In this work, we proposed a robust and reasonable response time with an ensemble of several traditional methods and a deep  learning method in the low SNR scenario. Here we assume the onset locations are already known and test different methods for clean audio, different noisy audio, and response time. Each method has its advantage and disadvantage. For the ML and the St FT methods, they tend to be influenced by noise within low frequency noise like in offices, train stations, and  Table Ii.

Using the concept of machine learning ensemble, we combine multiple methods that have small pitch error in both clean, noisy audio and short response time within 2s to get a robust f଴ estimation. Our idea is to find the property below and apply the additional algorithms to these methods. 1. Small pitch error in  both clean and noisy audio. 2. noisy audio includes SNR 5, 0, 10, and 20 with 17 different noises. SNR 30 is almost near ground truth while 10 is not hear able. 3. Short response time within 2s per song average from 10~ 20s songs. We take the median of HPS, St FT, ML, SRH, and Crepe with tiny pret rained model. We set the different frequency ranges for different methods to avoid high frequency noise beyond 1000 Hz as Table Ii. The different frequency ranges can be further researched in future work. In our research, we just empirically  set the minimum frequency, maximum frequency, and the harmonics numbers and then ensemble all the methods. VI. Simulation Results  For noise data, we use the UBC noise data set containing 17 different noise which covers most scenarios for QBH usage as one can imagine and the noise level is [5, 0, 10, 20]. The song data from our lab contains about 209 songs. Each song has 68 scenarios to consider. Table Iii is the overview of Tables I V and V which is the average of noises 1 to 17.

Possible improvements include:

1. Optimize the frequency ranges for each method based on their performance rather than using empirically set values. This could likely further reduce the overall error.

2. Experiment with weighting the different methods based on their performance for different noise levels and scenarios. Currently the median of all methods is taken, but weighting high performing methods more could improve accuracy. 

3. Expand the ensemble to include more pitch estimation methods, both traditional and deep learning based. A larger ensemble could provide more robustness against different noise types and levels.

4. Fine tune or retrain the deep learning model used (Crepe) specifically for pitch estimation in noisy conditions. The current pre-trained model was likely trained on clean data.

 "" The advent of large language models (LLMs) like Chat GPT and GPT4 has propelled the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (Bu becket al ., 2023) and unveiled human level abilities that warrant further exploration( Kos in ski, 2023; We i eta l., 2022). Among these abilities is the capacity to retain contextual information while engaging in multi turn conversations, suggesting the presence of working memory in these LLMs. Despite this intriguing observation, a systematic assessment of the working memory capacity of such models remains to be conducted. In this study, we drew upon cognitive sciences literature to devise working memory tasks for Chat GPT and compared its performance with human participants. In cognitive sciences, working memory is usually defined as the ability to temporarily store and manipulate information in mind( Bad dele y, 1992). It is widely regarded as a critical element of human intelligence, as it underlies various higher order cognitive processes such as reasoning, problem solving, and language comprehension( Conway&  Ko vacs, 2020). The study of working memory in A I has not received the attention it deserves until recent years. It is increasingly evident that in order to design more powerful A I models, the role of working memory must be taken seriously( Graves eta l., 2016; Guo eta l., 2020; Yoo& Collins, 2022). By placing a greater emphasis on working memory, A I researchers will be able to develop models that better mimic the cognitive processes underpinning human intelligence, leading to more efficient and versatile A I systems. The emergence of Chat GPT offers a unique opportunity to directly compare human and A I working memory. One widely used task to measure working memory capacity in laboratory settings is then back task, initially developed by Kirchner (1958). In the current study, we adapted two versions of then back task compatible with Chat GPT and assessed its performance using well established metrics from human behavior al studies. This approach allows us to obtain a deeper understanding of the working memory capacity of powerful LLMs like Chat GPT and facilitates a more meaningful comparison with human cognitive abilities.  Methods Inn back tasks, individuals are asked to report whether the currently presented item matches the item presented Nit ems ago. In this study, we devised two N back tasks involving verbal and spatial working memory (Szm alec eta l., 2011) respectively, and prompted Chat GPT( using the Open A I API) to complete the tasks in a trial by trial manner.  Fig. 1. Human( left) and A I( right) versions of the verbal N back task, with N= 2 chosen for illustration purposes. zxzqxq Match Match You are asked to perform a2 back task.

Only 'm' and'' are allowed responses. No exp lana< on s needed: please don't output any extra words !! The sequence will be presented one le8e rata< me. Now begins the task .mqzxqxmz Input Chat GPT Prompt ...... Verbal N back task For N= 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we generated 50 blocks of letter sequences using an alphabet commonly found in the literature. Each block contains 24 letters( thus 24 trials ), including 8 match trials and 16 non match trials. Fig. 1 illustrates how the same task would be conducted by human participants and how Chat GPT performed the task. Spatial N back task Based on the observation that Chat GPT can understand spatial relationships (Bu becket al ., 2023), we constructed a 3*3 grid using A Sci I art( see Fig. 2, right panel ). For N= 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we generated 50 blocks of grid sequences each featuring a letter “X” in one of the nine positions. Note that the letter “X” here was arbitrarily chosen to represent an occupied spatial location textually and could be substituted by any other letter or symbol. Each block contains 24 grids, including 8 match trials and 16 non match trials.  Fig. 2. Human( left) and A I( right) versions of the spatial N back task, with N= 2 chosen for illustration purposes. Results We anal y zed Chat GPT’s performance using widely accepted performance metrics reported in numerous human behavior al studies (Ja egg i eta l., 2010; Re dick& Lindsey, 2013), including hit rate, false alarm rate, accuracy (h it rate  false alarm rate ), and sensitivity (d′= Z(h it rate)  Z( false alarm rate )). Strikingly, the behavior al patterns of Chat GPT in both verbal( Fig. 3) and spatial( Fig. 4) N back tasks closely resembled those of human participants. The level of sensitivity was also comparable to humans reported in much of the literature( Kane eta l., 2007; Pele grin aet al ., 2015). The significant decline in Chat GPT’s performance as N increases (p values ≤ .001 for all K rusk al Wallis tests on hit rates, accuracy, and sensitivity) not only indicates that it has limited working memory capacity as humans do( Cow an, 2001), but also suggests that LLMs like Chat GPT may exhibit emergent properties( We i eta l., 2022) akin to the human brain. One exception occurred in the spatial N back task, with false alarm rates decreasing as N increased from 1 to 3 (p= .021), a pattern rarely reported in human studies.  Fig. 3. Chat GPT performance in the verbal N back task. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.  Fig. 4. Chat GPT performance in the spatial N back task. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Discussion It is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs’ abilities are constrained by their text based nature (Ma how ald eta l., 2023). For instance, it remains uncertain whether Chat GPT trull y processed the inputs in our spatial N back task from a “ spatial ” perspective. Nevertheless, future research should investigate the impact of various task manipulations, such as employing different stimuli or prompt state gie s, on Chat GPT’s working memory performance. Such exploration could provide valuable insights into how LLMs learn from task contexts and the extent to which the nature of A I working memory resembles that of humans.

 Now the material ends. What are some limitations of the working memory tasks used in this study to assess ChatGPT's capabilities?","
Potential limitations include:

1. The tasks are text-based and rely on ChatGPT's text processing abilities rather than any true spatial or verbal working memory. ChatGPT may be performing well due to its general language modeling capabilities rather than emulating human-like working memory.

2. The tests use simple stimuli like letters and grids which may not require much working memory capacity. More complex tasks would be needed to better assess ChatGPT's true limits.  

3. The tests provide immediate feedback after each response which may allow ChatGPT to implicitly learn patterns rather than truly memorizing and manipulating information over short time periods.

4. The tests only assess short-term retention over a span of 2-3 items. Broader tests would be needed to characterize ChatGPT's full working memory capacity.

5. ChatGPT's performance may be influenced by task-specific prompts and strategies rather than reflecting more general working memory abilities.

In summary, while the tasks provide initial insights, more sophisticated and varied working memory assessments would give a fuller picture of ChatGPT's capabilities and how they compare to human abilities. The text-based nature of the current tests also limits what they can reveal about ChatGPT's underlying mechanisms.","Potential answers:

1. The working memory tasks were adapted from existing cognitive science tasks which were designed for humans, not AI models like ChatGPT. This means they may not perfectly capture ChatGPT's abilities and limitations in a way that is comparable to human working memory. 

2. ChatGPT performed the tasks in an unnatural way, e.g. by simply generating responses of ""m"" or ""'"" rather than using more nuanced responses like humans do. This could skew the results and make it harder to compare ChatGPT's performance to human standards.

3. ChatGPT's performance in the tasks closely resembled that of humans, which suggests its abilities may be constrained by its text-based nature rather than mimicking true human working memory abilities. 

4. The tasks focused on short-term retention and recall, but not other aspects of working memory like task switching, inhibitory control, etc. So the results may only reflect ChatGPT's capabilities in those specific domains.

5. ChatGPT was tested using a limited number of items (N=2) in each task, which may not fully probe its true capacity or limitations. Testing over a larger range of items and tasks could reveal more about ChatGPT's working memory abilities.",0.295971154031194,0.23267326732673269,0.3917170027752082

 "" Using L Or Syringe Probes as a Method to Reduce Errors in Epidural Analgesia - a Robotic Simulation Study N. David or 1, Y. Bin yam in 2, T. Hay uni 2, and I. Ni sky 11 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ben Gur ion University of the Negev 2 Department of An est hes i ology, S or oka Medical Center nits anti@ post .bgu.ac.il Introduction In epidural analgesia, an est he tics are injected into the epidural space, to block signals from trave ling through nerve fibres in the spinal cord or near it. To do so, the an est hes iolo gist inserts a To uhy needle into the patient ’s skin and uses it to proceed to the epidural space, while using the hap tic feedback received from a \"" loss of resistance \"" (LOR) syringe to sense the environment stiffness and identify loss of resistance from potential spaces. The two most common errors or complications of epidural analgesia are failed epidurals (FE) - halting the needle insertion in a superficial location, which will cause no pain relief - and dur al punctures (DP), leading in most cases to post dur al puncture headache (PDPH). The task of identifying the epidural space correctly and stopping the needle insertion while in it is challenging mechanically, and requires extensive training [1]. Hence, robotic simulation is an attractive method to help optimize skill acquisition [2]. Another advantage of robotic simulation is the ability to record kinematic information throughout the procedure, to evaluate users ’ performance and strategy. In this study, we used a bim anu al robotic simulator that we developed in previous work [2] to anal yze the effect of L Or probing strategies on procedure outcomes. Materials And Methods Our experimental setup was comprised of a hap tic bim anu al simulator( Fig. 1), that has been validated by experts [2]. The simulator emulates the forces applied on the To uhy needle and the L Or syringe throughout the procedure( Fig. 2a), based on a force model proposed in [3], and allows for patient weight variability and recording kinematic data .23 an est hes io log is ts of different competency levels( division into levels was based on years of experience, case count and position - resident or attending [2]) participated in two experiments. The first experiment( N1=15) included three familiarization trials, in which there was a constant patient body mass, followed by 12 test trials that involved three different patient body masses (55, 85 and 115 kg). The second experiment( N2=8) included only the test trials. To eliminate differences in familiarization Fig .1 The experimental setup: a hap tic bim anu al simulator for epidural analgesia. One hap tic device is connected to a To uhy needle and the other is mounted by an L Or syringe. between the two experiments, we used only the final nine trials of experiment two for our analyses. To obtain L Or syringe probing movements, we subtracted the trajectory of the hap tic device that was connected to the To uhy needle from the trajectory of the hap tic device that was mounted by the L Or syringe. We then took the peaks of the adjusted trajectory and enumerated them. To examine if there were differences in probing amounts between different outcome trials, we plotted the mean number of probes performed in successful trials as a function of the mean number of probes performed in unsuccessful trials. This analysis is impossible for participants with success rates of 0% or 100%, and hence they were excluded from this analysis( Nex=4). We used the two sided Wilcox on signed rank test to compare between mean number of probes in successful and unsuccessful trials, since our data did not distribute normally. To further delve into probing differences between different outcome trials, we examined the mean number of probes performed in each layer in the epidural region, in successful and unsuccessful trials. To avoid bias that is rooted in the layer thickness, we normalized the mean number of probes in each layer by dividing it by the layer thickness. This part of the study is exploratory, and hence we chose not to perform statistical analysis ar Xiv :2305.04187v1  [cs.RO]  7 May 2023 for testing hypotheses, and instead use this part of the analysis as preliminary investigation for a future hypothesis driven study. Results We present examples of probes in two trials( Fig. 2): a successful trial, and a dur al puncture. Consistently with the trend observed in most of the participants and trials, more probes were performed in the successful trial. Fig. 2 Exerted forces and probes in two example trials .(A) Forces exerted by the hap tic devices as a function of needle insertion depth. (B)(C) The trajectories oft hel Or syringe hap tic devices as a function of the normalized time in is a successful trial (B) and an unsuccessful trial (C). The different background color sand numbering in all panels represent the layers in the epidural region. Studying the number of probes performed in successful trials against umber of probes in unsuccessful trials( Fig .3) demonstrates that most participants were above the line of equality, indicating that they performed more probes in successful trials, compared to unsuccessful trials( two sided Wilcox on signed rank test yielded p=00018). This result was not affected by participant level. Examining the locations of probes within the epidural region( Fig. 4) revealed that more probes were performed in successful trials compared to unsuccessful trials in all layers, and the most prominent differences were observed in the three layers preceding the epidural space. Discussion We used a hap tic bim anu al simulator to evaluate the effect of probing with the L Or syringe on procedure outcomes in epidural analgesia. We found that the majority of participants probed more in successful trials compared to unsuccessful trials. Furthermore, our results suggest that this difference is more prominent Fig. 3 The mean number of probes observed in unsuccessful trials as a function of the mean number of probes observed in successful trials. Each symbol represents one participant, and the different marker types and color s refer to the participant level.

Dashed black vertical lines represent the separation between the layers. The gray points represent the mean number of probes performed by each participant in the relevant layer, and the black bars represent the nonparametric mean 95% confidence intervals. in the three layers preceding the epidural space; we posit that this is caused due to higher caution when closer to the epidural space. These results indicate that a more extensive use of the L Or syringe( and more specifically, when approaching the epidural space) can assist in reducing errors in epidural analgesia. We argue that these findings may be useful in training an est hes i a residents( when training in the virtual environment or the real one ): instructing novices to focus on probing in relevant locations may enhance learning and produce better procedure outcomes. 
 Now the material ends. What are potential limitations with using haptic simulation to study epidural analgesia technique?","
Possible answer:

While haptic simulation can provide useful insights into epidural analgesia technique, it also has some potential limitations:

1. It is an artificial environment that does not fully capture the complexity of the real procedure. Factors like patient movement, anatomical variability, and the visual aspects of the procedure are difficult to replicate perfectly in simulation. 

2. Performance in simulation does not always correlate perfectly with real-world performance, especially for novices. Novices may struggle to translate skills learned in simulation to actual patients.

3. The force and tactile feedback models used in simulation are approximations and may not fully match the real feel of instruments and tissues during the procedure. This could impact how learners develop their technique.

4. The focus on certain metrics, like probing amount, in simulation could potentially lead learners to prioritize those metrics over other important aspects of technique when performing on real patients.

5. Learners may develop ""bad habits"" in simulation that are difficult to correct when transitioning to real procedures. Closer supervision may be needed during the simulation-to-reality transition.

In summary, while haptic simulation shows promise as a training method, researchers must be cautious in applying the results directly to the real world due to the limitations of simulation models. Validation studies comparing simulation performance with real-world performance are still needed.","Potential limitations include:

1. Model uncertainty: The force model used to simulate the haptic devices is an approximation of real-world forces and may not perfectly capture the feel of actual instruments. This could impact how learners develop their technique.

2. Limited feedback: The simulator only provides visual and/or audio confirmation of successful/unsuccessful trials, but does not provide more nuanced feedback on specific techniques that could be improved. 

3. Differences from real procedure: There are likely differences between the physical challenge and feel of real instruments and tissues during an actual epidural analgesia procedure, which may limit how much learners can generalize skills learned in simulation to the real world.

4. Learner variability: Learners vary in their technique and ability to develop good technique, even with extensive practice in simulation. This could impact the effectiveness of using simulation for training.

5. Cost and access: Access to haptic simulators is limited, and the cost of purchasing or building one can be high, which may limit their use for training purposes.

In summary, while haptic simulation shows promise as a training method, there are important limitations that need to be addressed through refinements in models, feedback, and validation procedures to more closely align with real-world epidural analgesia techniques.",0.3556920820343715,0.2604651162790697,0.389592003392686

Ni sky 11 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ben Gur ion University of the Negev 2 Department of An est hes i ology, S or oka Medical Center nits anti@ post .bgu.ac.il Introduction In epidural analgesia, an est he tics are injected into the epidural space, to block signals from trave ling through nerve fibres in the spinal cord or near it. To do so, the an est hes iolo gist inserts a To uhy needle into the patient ’s skin and uses it to proceed to the epidural space, while using the hap tic feedback received from a \"" loss of resistance \"" (LOR) syringe to sense the environment stiffness and identify loss of resistance from potential spaces. The two most common errors or complications of epidural analgesia are failed epidurals (FE) - halting the needle insertion in a superficial location, which will cause no pain relief - and dur al punctures (DP), leading in most cases to post dur al puncture headache (PDPH). The task of identifying the epidural space correctly and stopping the needle insertion while in it is challenging mechanically, and requires extensive training [1]. Hence, robotic simulation is an attractive method to help optimize skill acquisition [2]. Another advantage of robotic simulation is the ability to record kinematic information throughout the procedure, to evaluate users ’ performance and strategy. In this study, we used a bim anu al robotic simulator that we developed in previous work [2] to anal yze the effect of L Or probing strategies on procedure outcomes. Materials And Methods Our experimental setup was comprised of a hap tic bim anu al simulator( Fig. 1), that has been validated by experts [2]. The simulator emulates the forces applied on the To uhy needle and the L Or syringe throughout the procedure( Fig. 2a), based on a force model proposed in [3], and allows for patient weight variability and recording kinematic data .23 an est hes io log is ts of different competency levels( division into levels was based on years of experience, case count and position - resident or attending [2]) participated in two experiments. The first experiment( N1=15) included three familiarization trials, in which there was a constant patient body mass, followed by 12 test trials that involved three different patient body masses (55, 85 and 115 kg). The second experiment( N2=8) included only the test trials. To eliminate differences in familiarization Fig .1 The experimental setup: a hap tic bim anu al simulator for epidural analgesia. One hap tic device is connected to a To uhy needle and the other is mounted by an L Or syringe. between the two experiments, we used only the final nine trials of experiment two for our analyses. To obtain L Or syringe probing movements, we subtracted the trajectory of the hap tic device that was connected to the To uhy needle from the trajectory of the hap tic device that was mounted by the L Or syringe. We then took the peaks of the adjusted trajectory and enumerated them. To examine if there were differences in probing amounts between different outcome trials, we plotted the mean number of probes performed in successful trials as a function of the mean number of probes performed in unsuccessful trials. This analysis is impossible for participants with success rates of 0% or 100%, and hence they were excluded from this analysis( Nex=4). We used the two sided Wilcox on signed rank test to compare between mean number of probes in successful and unsuccessful trials, since our data did not distribute normally. To further delve into probing differences between different outcome trials, we examined the mean number of probes performed in each layer in the epidural region, in successful and unsuccessful trials. To avoid bias that is rooted in the layer thickness, we normalized the mean number of probes in each layer by dividing it by the layer thickness. This part of the study is exploratory, and hence we chose not to perform statistical analysis ar Xiv :2305.04187v1  [cs.RO]  7 May 2023 for testing hypotheses, and instead use this part of the analysis as preliminary investigation for a future hypothesis driven study. Results We present examples of probes in two trials( Fig. 2): a successful trial, and a dur al puncture. Consistently with the trend observed in most of the participants and trials, more probes were performed in the successful trial.

The different background color sand numbering in all panels represent the layers in the epidural region. Studying the number of probes performed in successful trials against umber of probes in unsuccessful trials( Fig .3) demonstrates that most participants were above the line of equality, indicating that they performed more probes in successful trials, compared to unsuccessful trials( two sided Wilcox on signed rank test yielded p=00018). This result was not affected by participant level. Examining the locations of probes within the epidural region( Fig. 4) revealed that more probes were performed in successful trials compared to unsuccessful trials in all layers, and the most prominent differences were observed in the three layers preceding the epidural space. Discussion We used a hap tic bim anu al simulator to evaluate the effect of probing with the L Or syringe on procedure outcomes in epidural analgesia. We found that the majority of participants probed more in successful trials compared to unsuccessful trials. Furthermore, our results suggest that this difference is more prominent Fig. 3 The mean number of probes observed in unsuccessful trials as a function of the mean number of probes observed in successful trials.

These results indicate that a more extensive use of the L Or syringe( and more specifically, when approaching the epidural space) can assist in reducing errors in epidural analgesia. We argue that these findings may be useful in training an est hes i a residents( when training in the virtual environment or the real one ): instructing novices to focus on probing in relevant locations may enhance learning and produce better procedure outcomes.

 ""1 Introduction Multi Cone R 2( Feta hue t al ., 2023b,a) is the second version of the Multi Cone R( Malm as i eta l.,2022) shared task. It focuses on identifying complex named entities in short sentences that lack context and addresses the challenge of identifying and distinguishing 30 fine grained entity types and of handling simulated errors, such as typos. Competition data is token zied and tagged with the Bio scheme, i.e. the label B for begin, I for inside, and Of or outside target entities. For this challenge, the 30 entity types were distinguished using suffixes to the Band I labels, e.g. B Corp and I Corp, as illustrated in Example 1.NER is frequently formulated as a sequence la be ling problem( Chi u and Nichols, 2016; Ma and Hovy, 2016; Wang eta l., 2022), in which a model learns to label each token individually using the Bio la be ling scheme. In contrast, span prediction approaches (Ji an get al ., 2020; Lie t al ., 2020; Fuet al ., 2021; Z hang eta l., 2023) label entire text spans with entity types. Recently, (Fu eta l., 2021) compared the two approaches and found that sequence la be ling performed better for long entities with low label consistency but that span prediction performed better for out of vocabulary words and entities of short to medium length. Because Multi Cone R 2 tests both, the ability to identify out of vocabulary entities and entities of varying length 1, it is interesting to compare the two approaches on this task. Our submission to the English Track does not use any external knowledge and holds rank 21 of 41 on Coda lab 2 with a macro F1 of 59.2 Submitted Systems 2.1 Token iz at ion The competition input consisted of token i zed data. The gold labels are given in form of Bio tags, where each token is labeled with a corresponding Bio tag as shown in Example 1. Sample input is given to XLM Roberta( Conn eau eta l., 2020) as the raw input string, without Roberta input tags such as <s> and </s> in the submission systems .(1) Token Biota gphar mao company Oe lib Corp lilly I Corp and I Corp company I Corp announced O2.2 Sequence La be ling Model Our sequence la be ling model uses XLM Roberta large( Conn eau eta l., 2020). Like all Bert derived models, Roberta splits the input tokens further into word piece sub tokens, for which the pret rained embedding vectors are included, and for which the sub token level output is generated. These sub tokens are classified into the Bio sequence. For submission and scoring, this sub token sequence has to be decoded into word level tokens .1 Creative work titles can be long, e.g. To Kill A Mockingbird 2https:// coda lab. lis n. ups a clay .fr/ competitions /10025# results ar Xiv :2305.03845v1  [cs.CL]  5 May 2023 Token Representation Step Given a sentence x= [w1; w2; :::; w n] with n word piece tokens, we generate for each token wia pret rained embedding ui using the last hidden layer of XLM Roberta large( Conn eau eta l., 2020) Embed (x)= Embed ([w1; w2; :::; w n])= [u1;u2; :::;un] Token Classification Step In this layer, we classify every token representation into a set of named entity types corresponding to the Bio( beginning, inside, outside) tagging scheme. Assuming \u0002 is the set of all named entity types, the set of all Bio tags Bis of size (2\u0002j\u0002j)+ 1. We use a linear layer to map each sub token ui2Rd to a prediction pi2RjBj, where dis the length of the token embedding. The predictions are used to calculate loss of sample x with n tokens as follows: Loss (x) =\u00001nnXi=1 log( Soft max (pi)yi) (1) Here yi represents the index of the gold Bio label of the it h token. Decoding Step For this task, the boundaries of each predicted span must align with actual word boundaries, which poses an issue due to the word piece token iz at ion. We align every predicted span with the nearest enveloping words. Concretely, let (b; e) represent the beginning and end offsets of a predicted spans. If ban de are contained in words wb and we respectively, they are remapped to the beginning and end offsets of the containing words .2.3 Span Prediction Model Token Representation Layer The token representation layer is identical to that of the Sequence La be ling model. Span Representation Layer Let a spans be a tuples= (b; e) where ban de are the begin and end word piece token indices, and s represents the text segment [wb; wb+1; :::; we] where wii st he it h word piece token. In this layer, we enumerate all possible spans, represented by the tuple (b; e). Because b\u0014e, there are n22 possible spans. We follow (Fu eta l., 2021) and encode each spans i as the concatenation of their begin and end word piece token embeddings vi= [ubi;uei]. The output of the decoding layer is V2Rk\u0002(2\u0002d) where k=n22 and dis length of the token embedding vector. Span Classification Layer In this layer, we classify each span representation with a named entity type. We introduce an additional label Neg_ Span which represents the absence of a named entity. In particular, a linear layer maps each span representation vi2R(2\u0002d) to a prediction pi2Rjj, where is the set of all named entity types( including Neg_ Span) and dis the size of the token embedding. The predictions are used to calculate the loss for sentence x with l possible spans as follows: Loss (x) =\u00001l lxi =1 log( Soft max (pi)yi) (2) Here yi represents the index of the gold label of the it h span. Decoding Similarly to the Sequence La be ling model, we align all spans with word boundaries. Because the Span Prediction model predicts overlapping spans, we remove overlaps with the following procedure :1. For each spans, ifs is completely contained within another spans, we remove s. We keep removing fully contained spans until none are left .2. For each spans 1 which partially overlaps another spans 2, we randomly select one of the two spans and remove it. We keep removing until no overlapping spans are left. The remaining spans are then mapped to Bio tags .2.4 Training XLM Roberta large is fine tuned on the training data using the Adam optimizer( King ma and Ba,2015) with a learning rate of 1e5 and a batch size of 1. The best model is selected using early stopping. Training for 10 epochs takes around 6 hours on one Nv id i art X 3090 gpu.3 Results and Discussion We evaluate all of our systems on the Coda lab Competition Website 3, where submissions are evaluated using the entity level macro F1 metric. All models 3https:// coda lab. lis n. ups a clay .fr/ competitions /10025 use the XLM Roberta large LM unless otherwise indicated. Table 1 shows the performance of the two submitted systems S( submitted) in bold. Post competition experimentation showed that increasing the batch size from 1 to 4 improved results by at least 3:2, this improvement is shown in Table 1 for systems B. We also found that adding the embeddings for Roberta special tokens <s> and </s> further improved performance, especially raising performance of the Sequence model Seq by 2:1, nearly erasing the performance advantage of the span based model.

 ""1 Introduction The environment can have a significant impact on user performance and experience. Virtual reality (VR) produces a highly realistic simulated environment with controllable environment variables. Many studies have proved that user status, experience, or performance can be affected by variables such as color, music, and light intensity in the environment [2]. However, few researchers have tried to dynamically adjust the user ’s state in real time by controlling these VR environmental variables. This work aims to establish a Dynamic Scene Adjustment (DSA) mechanism based on the user interaction state, as illustrated in Fig. 1. To enhance the user experience and overall performance( the core of user engagement ), the DSA mechanism dynamically modifies the VR environment variables according to the user ’s instant status* email: zl425u est c@g mail. com † email: eli eli 0925@qq. com ‡ Corresponding author, email: sean xiening@g mail. com § email: f you ten g@163. com ¶ email: tang hl1203@163. com || email: 37058836@qq. com and performance. The inspiration for this research comes from two aspects: a) When we physiologically monitor users ’ attention in the VR environment, we found that some experiment variables like color significantly impact the user ’s attention and performance during the task, which has also been reported in previous research [3, 5]. b) Referring to the mature Difficulty Dynamic Adjustment method [6], it should also be reasonable to improve the users ’ experience and overall performance by dynamically adjusting the VR environment through adaptive user ’s instant status and performance. We also designed ads A game demo based on the open source VR game Beat Sab er1. We invited 13 participants to conduct a total of 18 groups of comparative experiments on the DSA demo game. The experimental results show that adjusting the color( experiment variable) in the VR environment through adaptive user attention( status) and instant performance can simultaneously improve their experience and overall performance. This also proves the feasibility of the DSA mechanism. The user ’s engagement( experience, status, and overall performance) during the interaction process can be optimized by adjusting the interaction environment parameters .2 Dynamic Scene Adjustment Mechanism Design of the Dynamic Scene Adjustment (DSA) mechanism. Users are not only unilaterally affected by the environment; the decisions made at every moment and their status, performance, and experience can also affect the user ’s state at the next moment. Thus, the DSA mechanism can be described with the following equations .r\u0003t+1=DSA\u0003(At; rt)f:r!D;rt7!D\u0003t= f\u0000r\u0003t+1\u0001At+1; r\u0003t+1=G(At;rt;D\u0003t) R\u0003=Tåt=1r\u0003t+r0(1) where r is the world parameters, the function DSA\u0003() is the best DSA intervention strategy, At is users ’ status, rt is users ’ current performance, r\u0003t+1 is the user ’s performance after enhanced by the DSA mechanism at the next moment, At +1 is the status when the 1https:// beats a be r. com /ar Xiv :2305.04242v1  [cs.HC]  7 May 2023 user interacts with the scene adjusted by the DSA mechanism, the function G() is the game play rules. R\u0003 is the best user overall interaction performance, which is also the adjustment goal of the DSA mechanism. Dis the user ’s action, which satisfies the mapping relationship f with r. The intervention strategy DSA calculates the world parameters with users ’ status and performance as input. Many intervention strategies exist, and the best strategy DSA\u0003 will obtain the most suitable parameter r\u0003.r\u0003 will cause the user to take the best action D\u0003. After the user ’s state and action interact with the game play, their new status At and performance rt+1 will occur. This is the logic of the operation of the DSA mechanism. Therefore, the DSA mechanism mainly includes three modules. a) World parameters are the environmental variables that mainly affect the user ’s performance and experience. b) Adjustment goal is the expected state or desired experience of the users( or the anticipated state the examiner hopes participants can complete ). c) Intervention strategy is the calculation function of world parameters, which is the logic about how users achieve the adjustment goal. Game play design with DSA mechanism. In this part, we introduce our DSA game to readers according to the three main modules required by DSA, as illustrated in Fig. 2. We selected the background color in the VR environment as the world parameter rand set it to either red or blue. Because the selected game is a kind of musical rhythm VR game, it has been proven that color can influence users ’ attention, Red can stimulate users ’ attention, and Blue will keep users ’ attention stable [5]. Users ’ attention will influence users ’ experience [1] and performance [4]. We set the users ’ game score( user performance) in the VR environment as the adjustment goal. Regarding the intervention strategy, we input the user ’s real time attention and instant performance into the DSA strategy module, dynamically adjusting the world parameters selected( color) in this game. Users ’ instant performance is calculated by the user ’s score changes within an adjacent time window. The adjustment strategies of the game are illustrated in Table 1. We assume that the user ’s score ratio in the first time window is St, while in the second time window is St +1. Users ’ instant performance rt+1=St+1\u0000St. The time window size is 2.5 seconds which is the hyper parameters obtained after decoupling the game .3 Experiment Setup And Results Analysis Experiment Setup The experiment was supervised and guided by the Ethics Committee of U Est C. 13 participants, including 4 female and 9 male students between 20 and 28 years old, completed the comparative experiment. The game with( or without) the DSA mechanism is used as the experimental( control) group. Participants were asked to be involved twice in each experimental and control group experiment in random order. To avoid the impact of proficiency, all participants must practice several times before the formal experiment. Participants are given enough rest time after each game to avoid the impact of fatigue. The user ’s attention and task performance( game score) are collected and saved during the experiments. A short user experience interview is conducted after the experiment. Experiment Results With the DSA mechanism, 83.3% of the participants improved their performance. The paired sample t test results show that the test subjects performed better in the experimental group (M=86.13278, SD=8.79289) than in the control group (M=84.47861, SD=9.7518). The experimental results show that the DSA mechanism can improve the user ’s task performance in the VR environment. In addition, according to interview feedback, almost all participants reported that the experimental group was more excited and they experienced better than the control group .4 Conclusion In summary, this paper proposes the Dynamic Scene Adjustment (DSA) mechanism for dynamically improved user interaction performance by adjusting the world parameters in the VR environment Figure 2: DSA game pipeline, the upper part of the figure is the theoretical basis for adjustment goals and intervention strategies. The lower part is the specific DSA logic applied in the game Table 1: Dynamic Scene Adjustment Strategy No. User Performance( Score Ratio) User Status( Attention Level) World Parameters( Color )1 St +1\u0000St\u00150 High Blue 2 St +1\u0000St\u00150 Low Red 3 St +1\u0000St<0 Low Red 4 St +1\u0000St<0 High Maintain current scene color following the user ’s real time status and instant performance. In addition, we combined the DSA mechanism with a musical rhythm VR game and applied it to VR environment tasks. The experimental conclusions support the rationality of the mechanism. This work can help researchers think about dynamic regulation in VR environments from a new perspective. It can inspire the design of VR therapy, VR education, VR games, and other fields. Future research will expand the experimental data based on the existing DSA mechanism, adding more world parameters. In addition, we will want to establish a universal DSA mechanism through a data driven approach.

 Now the material ends. What are some limitations of the Dynamic Scene Adjustment mechanism described in the paper?","
Some possible limitations are:

1. The experiment only tested one environmental variable (background color) and more need to be tested to fully establish the mechanism. The paper acknowledges this limitation and suggests testing more parameters in the future. 

2. The experiments were conducted on a small sample size of only 13 participants. More participants would help validate the findings and ensure they generalize to the broader population.

3. The experiments measured subjective experience through interviews in addition to task performance. However, more objective measures of experience could be used to provide firmer evidence for how the DSA mechanism affects user experience.

4. The ""world parameters"" and ""intervention strategies"" tested were fairly basic and simple. More complex and nuanced strategies that account for individual differences in responses to environmental variables may further improve the effectiveness of the DSA mechanism.

5. The mechanism was only tested within the context of one particular VR game. Testing it across different VR tasks and environments would help establish its generalizability and robustness.

In summary, while the proposed Dynamic Scene Adjustment mechanism shows promise, more extensive experimental testing across multiple environmental variables, VR tasks, and participants is needed to fully establish and refine the mechanism. The limitations discussed provide possible directions for future research to build upon and improve the proposed mechanism.","Potential answers:

- The experiment only tested one environmental variable (background color) and more need to be tested to fully establish the mechanism. The paper acknowledges this limitation and suggests testing more parameters in the future. 

- The experiments were conducted on a small sample size of only 13 participants. More participants would help validate the findings and ensure they generalize to the broader population.

- The ""world parameters"" and ""intervention strategies"" used in the Dynamic Scene Adjustment are fairly vague and could be described in more detail to increase reproducibility. More specific variables and adjustment strategies would help clarify how the mechanism works.

- The experiments measured subjective experience through interviews in addition to task performance. However, more objective measures of user experience could provide stronger evidence for how the Dynamic Scene Adjustment actually improved user engagement.

- The paper only establishes a potential link between dynamically adjusting environmental variables and improved user performance and experience. More rigorous experimental designs would help prove cause and effect.

In summary, some key limitations are the lack of testing additional environmental variables, using a larger sample size, providing more detail on the specific intervention strategies used, measuring objective experience metrics, and establishing stronger causation between the Dynamic Scene Adjustment mechanism and improved user performance/experience. Addressing these limitations through expanded experiments could strengthen the findings and practical applications of the proposed mechanism.",0.5430918921659039,0.4943310657596372,0.5288428241809806

Thus, the DSA mechanism can be described with the following equations .r\u0003t+1=DSA\u0003(At; rt)f:r!D;rt7!D\u0003t= f\u0000r\u0003t+1\u0001At+1; r\u0003t+1=G(At;rt;D\u0003t) R\u0003=Tåt=1r\u0003t+r0(1) where r is the world parameters, the function DSA\u0003() is the best DSA intervention strategy, At is users ’ status, rt is users ’ current performance, r\u0003t+1 is the user ’s performance after enhanced by the DSA mechanism at the next moment, At +1 is the status when the 1https:// beats a be r. com /ar Xiv :2305.04242v1  [cs.HC]  7 May 2023 user interacts with the scene adjusted by the DSA mechanism, the function G() is the game play rules. R\u0003 is the best user overall interaction performance, which is also the adjustment goal of the DSA mechanism. Dis the user ’s action, which satisfies the mapping relationship f with r. The intervention strategy DSA calculates the world parameters with users ’ status and performance as input. Many intervention strategies exist, and the best strategy DSA\u0003 will obtain the most suitable parameter r\u0003.r\u0003 will cause the user to take the best action D\u0003. After the user ’s state and action interact with the game play, their new status At and performance rt+1 will occur. This is the logic of the operation of the DSA mechanism. Therefore, the DSA mechanism mainly includes three modules. a) World parameters are the environmental variables that mainly affect the user ’s performance and experience. b) Adjustment goal is the expected state or desired experience of the users( or the anticipated state the examiner hopes participants can complete ). c) Intervention strategy is the calculation function of world parameters, which is the logic about how users achieve the adjustment goal. Game play design with DSA mechanism. In this part, we introduce our DSA game to readers according to the three main modules required by DSA, as illustrated in Fig. 2. We selected the background color in the VR environment as the world parameter rand set it to either red or blue. Because the selected game is a kind of musical rhythm VR game, it has been proven that color can influence users ’ attention, Red can stimulate users ’ attention, and Blue will keep users ’ attention stable [5]. Users ’ attention will influence users ’ experience [1] and performance [4]. We set the users ’ game score( user performance) in the VR environment as the adjustment goal. Regarding the intervention strategy, we input the user ’s real time attention and instant performance into the DSA strategy module, dynamically adjusting the world parameters selected( color) in this game. Users ’ instant performance is calculated by the user ’s score changes within an adjacent time window. The adjustment strategies of the game are illustrated in Table 1. We assume that the user ’s score ratio in the first time window is St, while in the second time window is St +1. Users ’ instant performance rt+1=St+1\u0000St. The time window size is 2.5 seconds which is the hyper parameters obtained after decoupling the game .3 Experiment Setup And Results Analysis Experiment Setup The experiment was supervised and guided by the Ethics Committee of U Est C. 13 participants, including 4 female and 9 male students between 20 and 28 years old, completed the comparative experiment. The game with( or without) the DSA mechanism is used as the experimental( control) group. Participants were asked to be involved twice in each experimental and control group experiment in random order. To avoid the impact of proficiency, all participants must practice several times before the formal experiment. Participants are given enough rest time after each game to avoid the impact of fatigue. The user ’s attention and task performance( game score) are collected and saved during the experiments. A short user experience interview is conducted after the experiment. Experiment Results With the DSA mechanism, 83.3% of the participants improved their performance. The paired sample t test results show that the test subjects performed better in the experimental group (M=86.13278, SD=8.79289) than in the control group (M=84.47861, SD=9.7518). The experimental results show that the DSA mechanism can improve the user ’s task performance in the VR environment. In addition, according to interview feedback, almost all participants reported that the experimental group was more excited and they experienced better than the control group .4 Conclusion In summary, this paper proposes the Dynamic Scene Adjustment (DSA) mechanism for dynamically improved user interaction performance by adjusting the world parameters in the VR environment Figure 2: DSA game pipeline, the upper part of the figure is the theoretical basis for adjustment goals and intervention strategies. The lower part is the specific DSA logic applied in the game Table 1: Dynamic Scene Adjustment Strategy No. User Performance( Score Ratio) User Status( Attention Level) World Parameters( Color )1 St +1\u0000St\u00150 High Blue 2 St +1\u0000St\u00150 Low Red 3 St +1\u0000St<0 Low Red 4 St +1\u0000St<0 High Maintain current scene color following the user ’s real time status and instant performance. In addition, we combined the DSA mechanism with a musical rhythm VR game and applied it to VR environment tasks. The experimental conclusions support the rationality of the mechanism. This work can help researchers think about dynamic regulation in VR environments from a new perspective. It can inspire the design of VR therapy, VR education, VR games, and other fields. Future research will expand the experimental data based on the existing DSA mechanism, adding more world parameters. In addition, we will want to establish a universal DSA mechanism through a data driven approach.

 Now the material ends. Please summarize the paper in one paragraph."," Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Dynamic Scene Adjustment (DSA) mechanism to dynamically adjust VR environment variables in real time based on the user's interaction state to enhance their experience and performance. The DSA mechanism calculates the optimal environment variable(world parameter) based on the user's current status and performance using an intervention strategy. The chosen world parameter is then assigned the selected value to adjust the VR environment. A VR rhythm game was developed using color as the world parameter and user attention level and score ratio as input to the DSA strategy. Experiments show that the DSA mechanism improved user performance and generated a more exciting experience according to user feedback, supporting the effectiveness of dynamically adjusting the VR environment based on the user's real time state.","This paper proposes a Dynamic Scene Adjustment (DSA) mechanism to dynamically adjust VR environment variables in real time based on the user's interaction state to enhance their experience and performance.
