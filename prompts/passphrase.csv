Introduction Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without requiring data owners to share their private data. The privacy protection advantages of FL have gained significant attention from both academic and industrial fields. However, to obtain high quality models in FL, more clients are needed for local training, which inevitably consumes resources such as computation and communication costs. Additionally, recent advanced attack approaches have increased the risk of privacy leakage for clients in FL. As a result, no client is willing to participate in FL without reasonable compensation. Therefore, designing an incentive mechanism for FL is crucial in light of these considerations. In previous studies, researchers have explored designing incentive mechanisms to induce clients ’ participation based on simply assumptions on clients ’ capacities. For example, Zh an get al. [1] leverage historical clients ’ performance to estimate Correspondence to: LiChu ants a i <1201500112@jxufe.edu.cn> their current capacities and reputation, and design a reverse auction based incentive mechanism. A reputation based clients selection scheme is also combined with contract theory for FL incentive mechanism design [2]. Other studies consider the relationship between clients ’ hardware and their computation capacity or assume a deterministic capacity in problem settings [3]-[6]. However, none of these studies fully address the challenge of accurately estimating clients ’ capacities, such as their communication and computation abilities, in each round. One major challenge in estimating clients ’ capacities is that in cross device FL, clients are often Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited computation and communication abilities. The situation of these IoTs can be highly dependent on factors such as battery level and communication channels, which can introduce uncertainty and instability over time. Another challenge in accurately estimating clients ’ capacities is that clients ’ situations may be correlated. This is because different clients may share similar constraints, which may come from their participating activities, exposed environments, and their self physical constraint. As a result, estimating clients ’ capacities is often biased, which can lead to suboptimal choices when using existing incentive mechanisms in FL. Resolving these challenges is the core motivation of our work. In this paper, we consider a universal cross device FL, which contains wireless communication infrastructures and numerous IoTs. Then we propose a multilevel cross device FL architecture with the following contributions. To reward allocation under the limited budget and total utility optimization, we take the stochastic situations of clients into consideration. By anal y zing clients ’ historical performance and their correlation property in our FL architecture, portfolio theory is firstly leveraged to address this issue. The main contributions of our work can be summarized in the following points  four proposed multilevel cross device FL architecture is tailored to the demands of a universal cross device FL system featuring wireless communication infrastructures and a multitude of IoTs. The architecture is crafted to be highly adaptable and practical for real world implementation . Through our analysis of the uncertainty and correlation properties of clients in cross device FL, we investigate the ar Xiv :2305.04081v1  [cs.GT]  6 May 2023 challenges related to accurately estimating their capacities in light of these factors. As pioneers in this domain, we firstly propose the application of portfolio theory to tackle the capacity estimation challenges in cross device FL and design an effective incentive mechanism for it . To better capture the practical FL scenarios, we propose the Federated Learning Agent based Model (F Lab M) to simulate autonomous clients of FL. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach is significantly more effective and outperforms the benchmark methods. Ii. Related Work A key prerequisite for effective incentive mechanism design in FL is providing sufficient rewards to induce clients to participate in collaborative training. Previous studies in this field focus on addressing two subproblem s: fairness and optimization. While contribution measurement approaches such ass hap ley value and its variations have been widely used to address fairness problems in previous work [12], [13], they are less relevant for the optimizations, and particularly not related to biased sub optimality issues mentioned in this paper. To address the optimization problem, pioneers apply game theory based methods such as auction theory, Stack el berg game, and contract theory for incentive mechanism design. Deep reinforcement learning, a common means to solve dynamic problems in game theory, is also leveraged to compute Nash equilibrium and social welfare maximum [6], [7], [9], [14]. Zen get al. propose F More, in which the clients submit their bids with promised capacities to the aggregation server [8]. In their paper [9], Jiao eta l. do not take into account the stochastic property of clients ’ capacities, and propose an incentive mechanism for maximizing social welfare using deep reinforcement learning. In [6], clients deterministically decide their participation level based on per unit costs of communication and computation under given the total reward. The studies by Kan get al. [2] and Z hang eta l. [1] both employ a reputation mechanism for estimating clients ’ capacities and selecting nodes, by exploiting their historical performance .Zha net al. [7] propose an incentive mechanism, in which the clients automatically learn the best strategy based on deep reinforcement learning. In other settings, clients are able to determine their computation capacity to optimize their utility function [3]-[5]. However, all these works do not consider the uncertainty of clients ’ capacities over time, which can be obviously observed in Table I. Iii.

Based on the number of clients N,FL can be broadly divided into two categories: cross device FL and cross silo FL. The fundamental disparity between cross silo settings and cross device FL is that the former involves learning across a limited number of organizations that possess ample data, while the latter involves Internet of Things (IoT) clients, which can number in the millions. Consequently, the clients in cross device Flare much more unstable due to varying factors ’ status such as battery level, communication channel, and other limited resources. This results in unpredictable fluctuations in the number of time steps taken by IoTs. This paper focuses on cross device FL and proposes a multilevel federated learning architecture comprising IoTs, Edge Base Stations (EBSs), and Macro Base Stations (MBSs), as depicted in Fig. 1. The FL aggregation servers in this architecture can be high performance MBSs with abundant communication and computation resources, while the clients can be mobile devices with limited communication and computation resources. Notably, most of these mobile devices ’ conditions are unstable in real time due to the aforementioned reasons. As for EBSs, their computation and communication capabilities are intermediate between those of MBSs and IoTs. During the training process, MBSs function as aggregation servers and initialize the global model, which they then send model parameters to EBSs. Subsequently, EBSs regulate a group of IoTs and transfer these parameters to them. Like in conventional FL, these IoTs use their own data and local resources to update parameters and send them back to the transfer station, EBSs. Finally, MBSs are employed to perform

The fundamental disparity between cross silo settings and cross device FL is that the former involves learning across a limited number of organizations that possess ample data, while the latter involves Internet of Things (IoT) clients, which can number in the millions. Consequently, the clients in cross device Flare much more unstable due to varying factors ’ status such as battery level, communication channel, and other limited resources. This results in unpredictable fluctuations in the number of time steps taken by IoTs. This paper focuses on cross device FL and proposes a multilevel federated learning architecture comprising IoTs, Edge Base Stations (EBSs), and Macro Base Stations (MBSs), as depicted in Fig. 1. The FL aggregation servers in this architecture can be high performance MBSs with abundant communication and computation resources, while the clients can be mobile devices with limited communication and computation resources. Notably, most of these mobile devices ’ conditions are unstable in real time due to the aforementioned reasons. As for EBSs, their computation and communication capabilities are intermediate between those of MBSs and IoTs. During the training process, MBSs function as aggregation servers and initialize the global model, which they then send model parameters to EBSs. Subsequently, EBSs regulate a group of IoTs and transfer these parameters to them. Like in conventional FL, these IoTs use their own data and local resources to update parameters and send them back to the transfer station, EBSs. Finally, MBSs are employed to perform 
Introduction Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without requiring data owners to share their private data. The privacy protection advantages of FL have gained significant attention from both academic and industrial fields. However, to obtain high quality models in FL, more clients are needed for local training, which inevitably consumes resources such as computation and communication costs. Additionally, recent advanced attack approaches have increased the risk of privacy leakage for clients in FL. As a result, no client is willing to participate in FL without reasonable compensation. Therefore, designing an incentive mechanism for FL is crucial in light of these considerations. In previous studies, researchers have explored designing incentive mechanisms to induce clients ’ participation based on simply assumptions on clients ’ capacities. For example, Zh an get al. [1] leverage historical clients ’ performance to estimate Correspondence to: LiChu ants a i <1201500112@jxufe.edu.cn> their current capacities and reputation, and design a reverse auction based incentive mechanism. A reputation based clients selection scheme is also combined with contract theory for FL incentive mechanism design [2]. Other studies consider the relationship between clients ’ hardware and their computation capacity or assume a deterministic capacity in problem settings [3]-[6]. However, none of these studies fully address the challenge of accurately estimating clients ’ capacities, such as their communication and computation abilities, in each round. One major challenge in estimating clients ’ capacities is that in cross device FL, clients are often Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited computation and communication abilities. The situation of these IoTs can be highly dependent on factors such as battery level and communication channels, which can introduce uncertainty and instability over time. Another challenge in accurately estimating clients ’ capacities is that clients ’ situations may be correlated. This is because different clients may share similar constraints, which may come from their participating activities, exposed environments, and their self physical constraint. As a result, estimating clients ’ capacities is often biased, which can lead to suboptimal choices when using existing incentive mechanisms in FL. Resolving these challenges is the core motivation of our work. In this paper, we consider a universal cross device FL, which contains wireless communication infrastructures and numerous IoTs. Then we propose a multilevel cross device FL architecture with the following contributions. To reward allocation under the limited budget and total utility optimization, we take the stochastic situations of clients into consideration. By anal y zing clients ’ historical performance and their correlation property in our FL architecture, portfolio theory is firstly leveraged to address this issue. The main contributions of our work can be summarized in the following points  four proposed multilevel cross device FL architecture is tailored to the demands of a universal cross device FL system featuring wireless communication infrastructures and a multitude of IoTs. The architecture is crafted to be highly adaptable and practical for real world implementation . Through our analysis of the uncertainty and correlation properties of clients in cross device FL, we investigate the ar Xiv :2305.04081v1  [cs.GT]  6 May 2023 challenges related to accurately estimating their capacities in light of these factors. As pioneers in this domain, we firstly propose the application of portfolio theory to tackle the capacity estimation challenges in cross device FL and design an effective incentive mechanism for it . To better capture the practical FL scenarios, we propose the Federated Learning Agent based Model (F Lab M) to simulate autonomous clients of FL. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach is significantly more effective and outperforms the benchmark methods. Ii. Related Work A key prerequisite for effective incentive mechanism design in FL is providing sufficient rewards to induce clients to participate in collaborative training. Previous studies in this field focus on addressing two subproblem s: fairness and optimization. While contribution measurement approaches such ass hap ley value and its variations have been widely used to address fairness problems in previous work [12], [13], they are less relevant for the optimizations, and particularly not related to biased sub optimality issues mentioned in this paper. To address the optimization problem, pioneers apply game theory based methods such as auction theory, Stack el berg game, and contract theory for incentive mechanism design. Deep reinforcement learning, a common means to solve dynamic problems in game theory, is also leveraged to compute Nash equilibrium and social welfare maximum [6], [7], [9], [14]. Zen get al. propose F More, in which the clients submit their bids with promised capacities to the aggregation server [8]. In their paper [9], Jiao eta l. do not take into account the stochastic property of clients ’ capacities, and propose an incentive mechanism for maximizing social welfare using deep reinforcement learning. In [6], clients deterministically decide their participation level based on per unit costs of communication and computation under given the total reward. The studies by Kan get al. [2] and Z hang eta l. [1] both employ a reputation mechanism for estimating clients ’ capacities and selecting nodes, by exploiting their historical performance .Zha net al. [7] propose an incentive mechanism, in which the clients automatically learn the best strategy based on deep reinforcement learning. In other settings, clients are able to determine their computation capacity to optimize their utility function [3]-[5]. However, all these works do not consider the uncertainty of clients ’ capacities over time, which can be obviously observed in Table I. Iii.
